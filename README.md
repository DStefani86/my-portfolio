# Challenge 02 - Advanced CSS

## Description 

This challenge was definitely .... a challenge. This was my first assignment to create all my code from scratch which was fine at first but going back and forth between the html and css proved to be perilous
once i needed to style and position other things on the page. In the futre I will absolutely be writing all my HMTL first and then making the necessary adjustments in CSS. Due to the time constraints I did not get
EVERYTHING in the exact place I wanted it but I have to not be a perfectionist and turn in my assignment right now. LOL

## Installation
To install this project, fork the repository to your Gtihub account. Once on your Github account you can clone that sucker down. Work your way through the repository commits to see at what point I decided I needed to start over.


## Usage 

I created the html in the best sequential order I could. Once I realized I wasn't making any progress on positioning because of the changes I made before finishing the url I scrapped my css and rearranged the way I had my links and id's set up

Here's an example of the way I styled my buttons which I think turned out really well

Not sure if you can see from commits the changes I made (i forgot to take screenshots before I erased and restarted) but I'm ultimately happy with the styles I was able to come up with.
